# Stock Screener Project Rules

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Frontend: React with Material UI
- Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- API: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket for real-time updates

## Code Style
### Python
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use async/await for I/O bound operations
- Document functions with docstrings
- Use SQLAlchemy models for database operations

### JavaScript/React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use 2-space indentation
- Prefer destructuring for props
- Use named exports for components
- Organize components by feature

## Stock Data Processing
- Handle large datasets efficiently using numpy/pandas
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use appropriate data structures for performance
- Validate all incoming stock data

## Security
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Rate limit API endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all data from external sources

## Testing
- Write unit tests for backend services
- Write component tests for React components
- Test edge cases for stock data processing
- Mock external API calls in tests

## Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders in React
- Use efficient algorithms for stock screening
